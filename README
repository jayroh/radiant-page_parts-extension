= Page Parts

Content model enhancements to the PagePart model. Allows the
storage of native DB types (boolean, integer, and datetime) in addition to the
standard text content. Provides a foundation for creating richer content types
through PagePart subclasses.

== Usage

Install and run migrations. Now when adding a page part, you will be able to
specify what type. Content will be stored as a native representation
(DatetimePagePart in a datetime column, &c.), allowing for advanced operations
at the DB level. Further subclasses with custom behavior can be added by
providing your own model and admin partial.

 * Front-end rendering
 * Type-aware Radius tags
 * Indexes on additional content columns
 * Calendar picker JS
